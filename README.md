To run this program, you'll have to download and install PyQt5 library.

After PyQt5 has been installed, you can execute the program once you have downloaded and unzipped the file by inputting:
"python connect4.py"

The player moves first and is the color yellow. Select a column that you would like the token placed, the AI would then play
it's turn, this continues back and forth until a player has 4 of their pieces in a row.
